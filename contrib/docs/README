FusionDirectory 1.0 README
==========================

* Information

FusionDirectory is a LDAP administration frontend managing your network
including users, groups, systems, mail servers, voip etc...

Informations are stored the way the underlying concepts suppose them to be
stored but most of it can be configured that way you want most of the time.

Complete setups applying Kerberos, AFS, LDAP, Mail, Proxy and Fax setups
are not trivial at all. You should be familiar with these components and
with your UNIX installation, of course. This file is not an introduction
to any of these components. See INSTALL for a quick overview about what
to do, to get the things up and running.

* Translations

FusionDirectory is not available in your native language? Just read on...

We are using [[https://www.transifex.net/|transifex]] to translate FusionDirectory.

  * You just need to create an account [[https://www.transifex.net/plans/signup/free/|transifex]]
  * Join the team of the language you want to translate https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/FusionDirectory/
  * If your team doesn't exist you can ask for his creation

If you're ready with that, create a directory for your language using
the ISO shortcuts (i.e. es for spain).
In case of spain this will be

 fusiondirectory/locales/core/es

and put the freshly translated messages.po in this directory.

To test this, you've deploy the messages.po file in your running copy
of FusionDirectory and run the "fusiondirectory-setup --update-locales"
command, to let FusionDirectory merge the translations. Then, Make sure
your apache has locale support or, in case of debian, that the specific
locale will be generated (via dpkg-reconfigure locales).

For fusiondirectory-plugins, every plugin has a locales directory. Translation works
like described for fusiondirectory.

Always run fusiondirectory-setup --update-locales after you've added translations in
order to let FusionDirectory compile and re-sync the translations.

Have fun!
