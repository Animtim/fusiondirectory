1) DOWNLOADING FUSIONDIRECTORY
==============================

- Get the fusiondirectory tarballs from http://download.fusiondirectory.org/sources/1.0/.

wget http://download.fusiondirectory.org/sources/1.0/fusiondirectory-1.0.x.tar.gz

wget http://download.fusiondirectory.org/sources/1.0/fusiondirectory-plugins-1.0.x.tar.gz

X here being the latest version available

- Get the checksums file to be sure that the file where not corrupted

wget http://download.fusiondirectory.org/sources/1.0/CHECKSUM.MD5

- Compare the md5sum from fusiondirectory-1.0.x.tar.gz and
  fusiondirectory-1.0.x.tar.gz to the md5sum in CHECKSUM.MD5

cat CHECKSUM.MD5

md5sum fusiondirectory-1.0.x.tar.gz

md5sum fusiondirectory-plugins-1.0.x.tar.gz


2 ) INSTALLING FUSIONDIRECTORY CORE
===================================

- Unpack the FusionDirectory tarball and move the main fusiondirectory
directory to a place your webserver is configured to find it. On most
of the case this will be /var/www/fusiondirectory. Our fusiondirectory-setup script use
/var/www/fusiondirectory as default path.
 
For exemple, if you need to change the global path of FusionDirectory installation you can modify the variable 'fd_home':
  * fusiondirectory-setup --set-fd_home="/usr/share/fusiondirectory" --write-vars will change the path of your FusionDirectory installation.

Please note that --write-vars combined with --set-<variable_name>=<your data> will write your changes to the variables.inc file,
so its mandatory to use them together.

- Move the contrib/bin directory in /usr/local/bin
  * chmod 774 /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/bin/*
  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

- Create if needed the man5 et man1 directories in /usr/local/man
  * mkdir /usr/local/man/man1
  * mkdir /usr/local/man/man5

- Compress the manpages
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory.conf.5
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-encrypt-passwords.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-setup.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-mkntpassword.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-schema2ldif.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-insert-schema.1

- Move the man pages to the right place
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-encrypt-passwords.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-setup.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-mkntpassword.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-schema2ldif.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-insert-schema.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory.conf.5.gz /usr/local/man/man5

- Create the symbolic links for the fusiondirectory smarty functions

  Check that your smarty dir is in /usr/share/php/smarty or adapt the path accordingly
  
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/smarty/plugins/block.render.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/block.render.php
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/smarty/plugins/block.t.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/block.t.php
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/smarty/plugins/function.msgPool.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/function.msgPool.php
  
- Move the needed schema and ldif from contrib to your ldap server schema directory

  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/openldap/*.ldif <your-ldap-schema-directory>/fusiondirectory
  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/openldap/*.schema <your-ldap-schema-directory>/fusiondirectory

- Add the required schema

  * fusiondirectory-insert-schema

- check what schema are installed
    
  * ldapsearch -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -LLL -b cn=schema,cn=config | grep "dn: cn={"

- Run the fusiondirectory-setup

  * fusiondirectory-setup --check-directories --update-cache --update-locales

Please note that if you changed the path of your FusionDirectory installation you will need to type the following commands

  * fusiondirectory-setup --set-fd_home=<your path> --check-directories --update-cache --update-locales

- Move the needed file from contrib to your etc directory

  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/etc/* <your-etc-directory>/fusiondirectory

- Copy the file from contrib/fusiondirectory.conf to /var/cache/fusiondirectory/template

- INSTALLING FUSIONDIRECTORY PLUGINS

- Run the fusiondirectory-setup

  * fusiondirectory-setup --install-plugins

Please note that if you changed the path of your FusionDirectory installation you will need to type the following commands

  * fusiondirectory-setup --set-fd_home=<your path> --install-plugins
  
- Copy the file from contrib/apache to the apache site configuration dir

  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/apache/fusiondirectory-apache.conf <your-apache-configuration-directory>

- Reload your apache web server

http[s]://your-server/fusiondirectory

FusionDirectory setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a basic
fusiondirectory.conf to save in /etc/fusiondirectory. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.
