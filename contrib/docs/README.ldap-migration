* Migrating an existing tree

To migrate an existing LDAP tree, you've to do all steps from above,
plus some modifications:

- FusionDirectory only shows users that have the objectClass gosaAccount
  This one has been introduced for several reasons. First, there are
  cases you want to hide special accounts from regular admins (i.e.
  a samba admin account which is used to log windows machines into
  their domain, where changing a password by accident has bad consequences).
  Secondly the gosaAccount keeps the lm/nt password hashes and the
  attributes for the last password change - with the consequence that
  adding a samba account "later" will not require the user to reset
  the password.

- FusionDirectory only recognizes subtrees (or departments in FusionDirectory's
  view of things) that have the objectClass gosaDepartment. You can hide subtrees
  from FusionDirectory by not putting this objectClass inside.

The FusionDirectory setup may be used to do these migrations, but it is not meant
to work in every possible circumstance. Please be carefull when using it on
productive system. 

That should be all. Entries should be visible in FusionDirectory now. Be aware that if
your naming policy of user cn's differs from the way FusionDirectory handles it, the
entries get rewritten to a FusionDirectory style dn.
