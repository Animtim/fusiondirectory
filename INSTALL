Installing FusionDirectory from source:

- Get the fusiondirectory tarballs from http://download.fusiondirectory.org/sources/1.0/.
Here you will find the core fusiondirectory and fusiondirectory-plugins tarballs

- Unpack the FusionDirectory tarball and move the main fusiondirectory
directory to a place your webserver is configured to find it. On most
of the case this will be /var/www/fusiondirectory.

- Put the correct rights on the /var/www/fusiondirectory
  * chown -R root:root /var/www/fusiondirectory

- Move the contrib/bin directory in /usr/local/bin
  * mv -r /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/bin /usr/local/

- Create if needed the man5 et man1 directories in /usr/local/man
  * mkdir /usr/local/man/man1
  * mkdir /usr/local/man/man5

- Compress the manpages
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory.conf.5
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-encrypt-passwords.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-setup.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-mkntpassword.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-schema2ldif.1
  * gzip contrib/man/fusiondirectory-insert-schema.1

- Move the man pages to the right place
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-encrypt-passwords.1.gz /usr/local/man1
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-setup.1.gz /usr/local/man1
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-mkntpassword.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-schema2ldif.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory-insert-schema.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1/
  * mv contrib/man/fusiondirectory.conf.5 /usr/local/man5

- Create the symbolic links for the fusiondirectory smarty functions

  Check that your smarty dir is in /usr/share/php/smarty or adapt the path accordingly
  
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/include/smarty/plugins/block.render.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/block.render.php
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/include/smarty/plugins/block.t.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/block.t.php
  * ln -s /var/www/fusiondirectory/include/smarty/plugins/function.msgPool.php /usr/share/php/smarty/libs/plugins/function.msgPool.php
  
- Create the configuration directory /etc/fusiondirectory and make sure that your webserver can read it.

- Move the needed file from contrib to the /etc/fusiondirectory directory

  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/etc/* /etc/fusiondirectory

- Move the needed schema and ldif from contrib to the you ldap server schema directory

  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/openldap/*.ldif /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory
  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/openldap/*.schema /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory

- Run the fusiondirectory-setup

  * fusiondirectory-setup --create-dirs --update-cache --update-locales

- Install the FusionDirectory plugins

  * fusiondirectory-setup --install-plugins

- Copy the file from contrib/apache to the apache site configuration dir
  * mv /var/www/fusiondirectory/contrib/apache/fusiondirectory-apache.conf /etc/apache/conf.d

- Reload your apache web server

http[s]://your-server/fusiondirectory

FusionDirectory setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a basic
fusiondirectory.conf to save in /etc/fusiondirectory. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.
