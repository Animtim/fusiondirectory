FusionDirectory 1.0 QUICK INSTALL
=================================

Prequisite:

You have a system up and running. It has apache and PHP installed
and there is a blank (or prefilled) but working LDAP available.

---

Installing FusionDirectory from source:

Unpack the FusionDirectory tarball and move the main fusiondirectory
directory to a place your webserver is configured to find it. The default
location will be /usr/share/fusiondirectory. For later reference, I assume
that you've choosen this path, too.

Create the directory /var/spool/fusiondirectory for the smarty compile directory.
Make it read/write for the webserver (additional chmod 770). You may
want to move it elsewhere, configure it in fusiondirectory.conf.

Create the configuration directory /etc/fusiondirectory and make sure
that your webserver can read it.

As a summmary, you now have these directories for FusionDirectory:

/etc/fusiondirectory
/var/spool/fusiondirectory
/usr/share/fusiondirectory

Update the class cache:

Run "update-fusiondirectory" from the FusionDirectory main directory.

After this has been done, include settings for FusionDirectory in your apache
config:

# Set alias to FusionDirectory
Alias /fusiondirectory /usr/share/fusiondirectory/html

Assumed you've installed PHP >= 5.2.0, reload your apache webserver
and do your first FusionDirectory dry run without configuration:

http[s]://your-server/fusiondirectory

FusionDirectory setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a basic
fusiondirectory.conf to save in /etc/fusiondirectory. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.

* Installing from Packages

If you install FusionDirectory from packages, all the steps from above will
be done automatically. Go to the setup:

http[s]://your-server/fusiondirectory

FusionDirectory setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a basic
fusiondirectory.conf to save in /etc/fusiondirectory. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.

* Migrating an existing tree

To migrate an existing LDAP tree, you've to do all steps from above,
plus some modifications:

- FusionDirectory only shows users that have the objectClass gosaAccount
  This one has been introduced for several reasons. First, there are
  cases you want to hide special accounts from regular admins (i.e.
  a samba admin account which is used to log windows machines into
  their domain, where changing a password by accident has bad consequences).
  Secondly the gosaAccount keeps the lm/nt password hashes and the
  attributes for the last password change - with the consequence that
  adding a samba account "later" will not require the user to reset
  the password.

- FusionDirectory only recognizes subtrees (or departments in FusionDirectory's
  view of things) that have the objectClass gosaDepartment. You can hide subtrees
  from FusionDirectory by not putting this objectClass inside.

The FusionDirectory setup may be used to do these migrations, but it is not meant
to work in every possible circumstance. For the first time:

DO NOT WORK ON PRODUCTIVE DATA IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

That should be all. Entries should be visible in FusionDirectory now. Be aware that if
your naming policy of user cn's differs from the way FusionDirectory handles it, the
entries get rewritten to a FusionDirectory style dn.
