FusionDirectory 1.0 README
==========================

* Information

FusionDirectory is a LDAP administration frontend for user administration.
It is not a generic frontend to ldap servers. Informations are stored
in the way the underlying concepts suppose them to be stored (i.e.
people accounts are stored in "ou=people" subtrees, etc.) This can
be configured marginally.

Complete setups applying Kerberos, AFS, LDAP, Mail, Proxy and Fax setups
are not trivial at all. You should be familiar with these components and
with your UNIX installation, of course. This file is not an introduction
to any of these components. See INSTALL for a quick overview about what
to do, to get the things up and running.

* Translations

FusionDirectory is not available in your native language? Just read on...

Translations (or I18N) in FusionDirectory is done by the gettext library.
As a result, every set of translations is stored inside of one directory
per language as a text file called "messages.po".

For FusionDirectory you've to differenciate between fusiondirectory and
fusiondirectory-plugins. The core as a translation and every plugin has
a seperate translation, too.

FusionDirectory core can be translated by taking a look at the locales/core
directory. Just take the messages.po file and copy it to some other
location and put your translations into the msgstr fields of this
file. For more comfort, use programs like i.e. kbabel or poedit to
achieve this. You may look at the de/LC_MESSAGES for the way how it
works.

If you're ready with that, create a directory for your language using
the ISO shortcuts (i.e. es for spain) with a subdirectory LC_MESSAGES.
In case of spain this will be

 fusiondirectory/locales/core/es/LC_MESSAGES

and put the freshly translated messages.po in this directory.

To test this, you've deploy the messages.po file in your running copy
of FusionDirectory and run the "update-fusiondirectory" command, to let
FusionDirectory merge the translations. Then, Make sure your apache has
locale support or, in case of debian, that the specific locale will be
generated (via dpkg-reconfigure locales).

You may want your translations to be included in the main FusionDirectory repository,
then just send the .po file to us.

For fusiondirectory-plugins, every plugin has a locales directory. Translation works
like described for fusiondirectory.

Always run update-fusiondirectory after you've added translations in order to let
FusionDirectory compile and re-sync the translations.


* NOTES

Be sure that 'gosaUserTemplates' are not able to log into your server,
since they may have no password set. Example configs can be found in
the contrib directory.

Have fun!
